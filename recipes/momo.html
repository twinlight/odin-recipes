    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are bite sized snacks from Nepal and Tebet but they have made their way around the globe and are now popular everywhere. I like to think of chicken momos like chicken samosas but so much lighter.

        
        </p>
        <p>
            The chicken momo wraps are similar to those used in samosas but chicken momos are steamed and much less calorific. Would you like to try another filling? Go for it! Make up your own or try my chciken momos or vegetable momos.  
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>225g (8 oz) plain flour, sifted</li>
            <li>75g (2.6 oz) cornflour (corn starch), sifted</li>
            <li>Water – about 170ml</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>300g (11oz) lean ground chicken</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2.5cm (1 inch) piece of ginger, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 spring onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 lemongrass stalk, white part only, thinly sliced and chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 green finger chillies, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making your momo dough, if making. Sift the flours and salt into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the water while mixing until you have a firm but soft dough. If the dough is too wet, add more flour. Too dry, add a little more water. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it is, add a bit more flour.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough and place, covered in the refrigerator for at least 60 minutes or overnight. A minimum of one hour sitting time will be best.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mix the chicken with all the other filling ingredients together until well combined.</li>
            <li>When ready to make your chicken momos, roll the dough into a long snake shape that is about 2.5cm (1 inch in diameter.
                Divide this dough into smaller pieces. For reference, I divide mine into 13 to 14g balls so that each of the momos are about the same size. You could just do this by eye though as shown in the photos above.</li>
            <li>Keep the small balls covered while you work to avoid drying. Take one of the balls and flatten it some with your fingers and then roll out into a circle shape that is about 2mm thick and 9cm in diameter. This is assuming you are using 13 - 14g pieces so the size of your momo wrappers may differ.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of the chicken mixture onto the wrapper and dampen around sides of the circle with water using your finger and fold it over into a half circle and the pinch one of the ends together.</li>
            <li>Now press the rest of the half circle together while pressing with your thumb to make a moon shape and sealing by pleating the seam.</li>
            <li>Cover and repeat with the rest of the dough. You may have some of the chicken mixture left over but I'm sure you can find a use for it. Throw it into a pasta sauce for example.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken momos in your steamer and steam for 5 to 6 minutes. The dough will become soft. You may need to do this in batches as it is important that the momos not touch each other while steaming or they will stick together.
            </li>
            <li>Eat immediately with soy sauce and/or chilli sauce.</li>
           
        </ol>
